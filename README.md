##DESCRIPTION:

This project is a Java-based file handling utility designed to demonstrate the fundamental operations involved in handling text files. The script enables users to write, read, and modify a text file using Java’s built-in FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader classes.

File handling is an essential part of Java programming, especially for applications that deal with data storage, configuration management, and log handling. This script provides a practical demonstration of how to create, update, and read text files efficiently.

This project serves as an introductory exercise for learning Java I/O (Input/Output) operations, making it useful for beginners and those looking to enhance their skills in file handling.

## Project Structure

/FileHandlingJava
│── FileHandler.java   # Java program for file operations
│── sample.txt         # Auto-generated text file
│── README.md          # Documentation file

##Tools & Technologies Used:
This project was built using the following tools and technologies:

1.Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or later) – Required for compiling and running Java programs.
2.VS Code (Visual Studio Code) – Used as the code editor and IDE for writing and testing the program.
3.Git & GitHub – Used for version control and storing the project repository online.
4.Command Line/Terminal – For compiling and executing the Java program.

##Features & Functionalities
This program consists of the following key features:

✅ File Creation & Writing – The program creates a text file (sample.txt) and writes initial content into it.
✅ Reading File Content – The program reads and displays the file content on the console.
✅ Appending Data to the File – The script modifies the file by appending additional text.
✅ Exception Handling – It includes error handling mechanisms to manage potential file-related errors (e.g., file not found, permission issues).


##How the Program Works??
The program follows a step-by-step approach:

*Write Operation: The program writes predefined content to sample.txt (overwriting if it exists).
*Read Operation: It then reads and prints the file’s content to the console.
*Modify Operation: The program appends new content to the file.
*Final Read Operation: The updated content is displayed.

## How to Run the Program
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Open a terminal or command prompt and execute:
git clone <repository_url>
cd FileHandlingJava

2️⃣ Compile the Java Program
javac FileHandler.java

3️⃣ Run the Java Program
java FileHandler

4️⃣ Expected Console Output:
File written successfully.
Reading file after writing:
This is the initial content of the file.

File modified successfully.

Reading file after modification:
This is the initial content of the file.
Adding more text to the file.
